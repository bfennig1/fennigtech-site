      <h2>Lessons Learned Managing Multi-Million Dollar Security System Installs</h2>
      <p><strong>By Brian Fennig</strong></p>
      <p>Over the past 15 years, I’ve overseen the installation and project management of security systems in environments ranging from hospitals and universities to casinos and international airports. Managing projects with budgets in excess of $1M taught me critical lessons in planning, adaptability, and technical precision.</p>
      <p>Here’s what I’ve learned:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Plan for the unknown</strong>: Scope creep and unexpected site conditions are inevitable—build contingency time into your schedule and budget.</li>
        <li><strong>Communication is king</strong>: Whether it's coordinating subcontractors or updating clients, clarity prevents costly mistakes.</li>
        <li><strong>Documentation wins trust</strong>: Having clear, client-facing documentation for every phase of the install shows professionalism and keeps stakeholders aligned.</li>
        <li><strong>Test early, test often</strong>: Issues found at commissioning are much harder to solve than those caught during build-out.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For any business considering a major security system installation, I recommend choosing a partner who not only understands the technology but has the logistical know-how to lead complex projects.
