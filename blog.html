      <h2>Lessons Learned Managing Multi-Million Dollar Security System Installs</h2>
      <p><strong>By Brian Fennig</strong></p>
      <p>Over the past 15 years, I’ve overseen the installation and project management of security systems in environments ranging from hospitals and universities to casinos and international airports. Managing projects with budgets in excess of $1M taught me critical lessons in planning, adaptability, and technical precision.</p>
      <p>Here’s what I’ve learned:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Plan for the unknown</strong>: Scope creep and unexpected site conditions are inevitable—build contingency time into your schedule and budget.</li>
        <li><strong>Communication is king</strong>: Whether it's coordinating subcontractors or updating clients, clarity prevents costly mistakes.</li>
        <li><strong>Documentation wins trust</strong>: Having clear, client-facing documentation for every phase of the install shows professionalism and keeps stakeholders aligned.</li>
        <li><strong>Test early, test often</strong>: Issues found at commissioning are much harder to solve than those caught during build-out.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For any business considering a major security system installation, I recommend choosing a partner who not only understands the technology but has the logistical know-how to lead complex projects.

  <h2>Top 5 Common Mistakes in Security System Installations (And How to Avoid Them)</h2>
  <p><strong>By Brian Fennig</strong></p>

  <p>With over 15 years managing large-scale security projects, I’ve seen firsthand the mistakes that can derail even well-funded installations. Whether you're securing a hospital, a university, or a casino, avoiding these pitfalls can save time, money, and reputation.</p>

  <p>Here are the top five mistakes I see over and over:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Incomplete Site Surveys:</strong> Skipping a detailed walkthrough leads to surprises — like structural obstacles or poor wireless signal coverage. A proper survey is your blueprint for success.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Underestimating Infrastructure:</strong> Many clients forget that cameras and access control systems require robust cabling, adequate power, and reliable network bandwidth. Failing to plan for this leads to costly rewiring later.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Poor Vendor Coordination:</strong> Security systems often overlap with IT, construction, and electrical work. If these teams aren't aligned, schedules slip and finger-pointing starts.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Rushed Testing:</strong> Skipping or rushing testing and commissioning leads to missed failures. Testing should include failover checks, camera aim verification, access credential control, and user response times.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Neglecting End-User Training:</strong> A system is only as effective as the people using it. A clear handoff with documentation and on-site training builds confidence and trust.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>I've built my career on avoiding these mistakes. If you need someone who can lead security projects from survey to sign-off with professionalism and precision, <a href="index.html#contact">reach out to me here</a>.</p>
