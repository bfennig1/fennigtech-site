      <h2>Lessons Learned Managing Multi-Million Dollar Security System Installs</h2>
      <p><strong>By Brian Fennig</strong></p>
      <p>Over the past 15 years, I’ve overseen the installation and project management of security systems in environments ranging from hospitals and universities to casinos and international airports. Managing projects with budgets in excess of $1M taught me critical lessons in planning, adaptability, and technical precision.</p>
      <p>Here’s what I’ve learned:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Plan for the unknown</strong>: Scope creep and unexpected site conditions are inevitable—build contingency time into your schedule and budget.</li>
        <li><strong>Communication is king</strong>: Whether it's coordinating subcontractors or updating clients, clarity prevents costly mistakes.</li>
        <li><strong>Documentation wins trust</strong>: Having clear, client-facing documentation for every phase of the install shows professionalism and keeps stakeholders aligned.</li>
        <li><strong>Test early, test often</strong>: Issues found at commissioning are much harder to solve than those caught during build-out.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For any business considering a major security system installation, I recommend choosing a partner who not only understands the technology but has the logistical know-how to lead complex projects. If you're interested in a consultation or project management support, <a href="index.html#contact">get in touch</a>.</p>

  <h2>Top 5 Common Mistakes in Security System Installations (And How to Avoid Them)</h2>
  <p><strong>By Brian Fennig</strong></p>

  <p>With over 15 years managing large-scale security projects, I’ve seen firsthand the mistakes that can derail even well-funded installations. Whether you're securing a hospital, a university, or a casino, avoiding these pitfalls can save time, money, and reputation.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>1. Incomplete Site Surveys</strong><br>
    Skipping a detailed site walkthrough leads to surprises during install. Structural obstacles, power constraints, or signal interference can delay your timeline and blow your budget.</li>

    <li><strong>2. Underestimating Infrastructure Needs</strong><br>
    Cabling, power access, and network capacity often get overlooked. If you're installing IP cameras or access control, make sure your backbone infrastructure can handle the load.</li>

    <li><strong>3. Poor Vendor Coordination</strong><br>
    Integrators, electricians, and IT teams need to be tightly coordinated. Miscommunication here can lead to incompatible equipment, scheduling gaps, or finger-pointing when things go wrong.</li>

    <li><strong>4. Rushed Testing and Commissioning</strong><br>
    Testing is more than just flipping a switch. Rushing this phase results in service calls, missed coverage zones, and unhappy clients. Build time into the schedule for thorough QA.</li>

    <li><strong>5. No User Training or Handoff</strong><br>
    Delivering a system without training or documentation leaves clients in the dark. A professional handoff with user guides and a walk-through builds trust and ensures long-term success.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Avoiding these mistakes requires proactive project management, deep technical insight, and clear communication — all things I bring to every job. If your organization needs a trusted partner to lead complex security installations, <a href="index.html#contact">contact me here</a>.</p>
