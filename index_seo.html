      <h2>Lessons Learned Managing Multi-Million Dollar Low Voltage System Installs</h2>
      <p><strong>By Brian Fennig</strong></p>
      <p>Over the past 15 years, I’ve overseen the installation and project management of security systems in environments ranging from hospitals and universities to casinos and international airports. Managing projects with budgets in excess of $1M taught me critical lessons in planning, adaptability, and technical precision.</p>
      <p>Here’s what I’ve learned:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Plan for the unknown</strong>: Scope creep and unexpected site conditions are inevitable—build contingency time into your schedule and budget.</li>
        <li><strong>Communication is king</strong>: Whether it's coordinating subcontractors or updating clients, clarity prevents costly mistakes.</li>
        <li><strong>Documentation wins trust</strong>: Having clear, client-facing documentation for every phase of the install shows professionalism and keeps stakeholders aligned.</li>
        <li><strong>Test early, test often</strong>: Issues found at commissioning are much harder to solve than those caught during build-out.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For any business considering a major security system installation, I recommend choosing a partner who not only understands the technology but has the logistical know-how to lead complex projects. If you're interested in a consultation or project management support, <a href="index.html#contact">get in touch</a>.</p>

      <h2>Top 5 Common Mistakes in Low Voltage System Installations (And How to Avoid Them)</h2>
      <p><strong>By Brian Fennig</strong></p>

      <p>With over 15 years managing large-scale security projects, I’ve seen firsthand the mistakes that can derail even well-funded installations. Whether you're securing a hospital, a university, or a casino, avoiding these pitfalls can save time, money, and reputation.</p>

      <p>Here are the top five mistakes I see over and over:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Incomplete site surveys</strong>: Skipping a detailed walkthrough leads to surprises — like structural obstacles or poor wireless signal coverage. A proper survey is your blueprint for success.</li>
        <li><strong>Underestimating infrastructure</strong>: Many clients forget that cameras and access control systems require robust cabling, adequate power, and reliable network bandwidth. Failing to plan for this leads to costly rewiring later.</li>
        <li><strong>Poor vendor coordination</strong>: Security systems often overlap with IT, construction, and electrical work. If these teams aren't aligned, schedules slip and finger-pointing starts.</li>
        <li><strong>Rushed testing</strong>: Skipping or rushing testing and commissioning leads to missed failures. Testing should include failover checks, camera aim verification, access credential control, and user response times.</li>
        <li><strong>Neglecting end-user training</strong>: A system is only as effective as the people using it. A clear handoff with documentation and on-site training builds confidence and trust.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>I’ve built my career on avoiding these mistakes. If you need someone who can lead security projects from survey to sign-off with professionalism and precision, <a href="index.html#contact">reach out to me here</a>.</p>

      <h2>How to Choose the Right Low Voltage Contractor for Your Next Project</h2>
      <p><strong>By Brian Fennig</strong></p>

      <p>When you're planning a new structured cabling, access control, or AV integration project, one of the most important decisions you'll make is selecting the right low voltage contractor. The wrong choice can cost you time, money, and operational headaches — while the right partner brings value long after the install is done.</p>

      <p>Here are five things to look for when choosing a low voltage contractor:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>1. Proven Experience with Your Type of Facility</strong><br>
        Hospitals, casinos, schools, and airports all have different code requirements, construction challenges, and technology needs. Make sure your contractor has a track record in environments like yours.</li>

        <li><strong>2. Clear Project Communication</strong><br>
        You want a contractor who brings transparency and proactive updates, not one who goes silent until problems arise. Communication is a core part of successful delivery.</li>

        <li><strong>3. Certified Technicians & Quality Gear</strong><br>
        Ask about certifications (like BICSI, Panduit, or Lenel) and the type of hardware they use. Cheap equipment leads to expensive failures.</li>

        <li><strong>4. Documented Processes</strong><br>
        From cable testing reports to as-built drawings, documentation is more than paperwork — it protects your investment and enables smooth service later.</li>

        <li><strong>5. Post-Install Support</strong><br>
        What happens after the system goes live? Do they offer support, training, and warranty follow-ups? A good contractor doesn't vanish after the last invoice.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>As someone who’s managed projects across North America for over 15 years, I’ve built my career on doing things the right way the first time. If your organization needs an experienced, detail-oriented low voltage partner, <a href="index.html#contact">let’s talk</a>.</p>

      <h2>5 Questions to Ask Before Hiring a Low Voltage Contractor</h2>
      <p><strong>By Brian Fennig</strong></p>

      <p>Whether you're building out a new office, upgrading your surveillance system, or planning a large AV installation, choosing the right low voltage contractor is critical. The wrong one will cost you time, money, and headaches. The right one will save you all three.</p>

      <p>Here are five smart questions to ask before you hire:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>1. Are you certified in the systems you install?</strong><br>
        A qualified contractor should hold certifications from manufacturers (like Panduit, BICSI, Lenel, etc.). This ensures you get a properly designed and warrantied system.</li>

        <li><strong>2. Can I see examples of past work?</strong><br>
        Any serious contractor should have a portfolio, case study, or at least photos of previous jobs. Look for experience in facilities similar to yours (healthcare, education, warehouse, etc.).</li>

        <li><strong>3. Who will be doing the actual work?</strong><br>
        Ask whether the job will be done in-house or subcontracted. You want to know who will be on your property and whether they’re background checked and trained.</li>

        <li><strong>4. How do you handle documentation and labeling?</strong><br>
        Clean, labeled, and properly documented work matters — especially for future service. Make sure they offer as-builts, test results, and cable maps.</li>

        <li><strong>5. What’s your communication process during the project?</strong><br>
        Good contractors keep you in the loop with schedule updates, change order approvals, and punch list tracking. Poor communication is a major red flag.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>As someone with over 15 years in the low voltage industry, I’ve seen projects succeed or fail based on who’s managing the cable behind the walls. If you're planning a structured cabling, access control, or AV project — and you want it done right — <a href="index.html#contact">reach out</a>. I’m happy to share what I’ve learned.</p>

      <h2>Why Commissioning Is the Most Overlooked Step in Low-Voltage Projects</h2>
      <p><strong>By Brian Fennig</strong></p>
      <p>Over the years, I’ve been brought in to fix countless low-voltage installations that “should have worked”—but didn’t. The common thread? Poor or nonexistent commissioning.</p>
      <p>In AV, security, or structured cabling systems, commissioning is the quality control phase that turns design into dependable performance. It's not just a checkbox—it's the difference between delivering a project and delivering a solution.</p>

      <h3>What Is Commissioning?</h3>
      <p>Commissioning verifies that all systems—hardware, software, and infrastructure—perform according to the original design intent. It includes functional testing, documentation, punch-list resolution, and client handover.</p>

      <h3>What Happens When You Skip It?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Inconsistent results:</strong> Devices fail under load or stop syncing.</li>
        <li><strong>Blame games:</strong> IT blames AV, AV blames the GC, and the client is left frustrated.</li>
        <li><strong>Delayed turnovers:</strong> Incomplete systems sit idle while invoices pile up.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Commissioning = Accountability</h3>
      <p>Done right, commissioning shows professionalism, keeps all trades honest, and helps avoid rework. Whether I’m managing a $1M security project or a small office AV install, I never skip it—and neither should you.</p>

      <p>If you’re planning a new build or system upgrade, make sure commissioning is baked into your scope. Or give me a call—I’d be glad to help plan it from day one.</p>
